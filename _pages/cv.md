Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 2027 (expected)
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 2022
* B.S. in Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 2020
* B.S. in Applied Mathematics, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 2020


Experience
======
* Summer 2024 & 2025: Applied Scientist Intern - Amazon
  * Designed a multi-modal item representation learning framework that integrates item-item relationships and diverse content modalities, achieving up to a 39.2% improvement over current methods across five real-world datasets, with strong effectiveness in cold-start and sparse data scenarios.
  * Implemented an invariant item representation learning framework to address spurious multi-modal item information in sequential recommendation, demonstrating up to a 10.5% improvement over existing methods on multiple real-world datasets, particularly excelling in cold-start scenarios.
