I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/), [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), working with [Prof. Hari Sundaram](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/). 
I received both my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2020 and 2022.

I was also an Applied Scientist Intern  at Entity Resolution (2022) and International Machine Learning (2024) team @[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).
 
My broader research interests include recommender systems and graph neural networks.

 <!-- My broader research interests include recommender systems and graph neural networks, with a particular focus on the challenges of **<u>sparsity</u>** in these systems, such as long-tail item recommendation. Currently, I'm also exploring LLM-enhanced recommendation systems and causal representation learning. . -->
